        <p class="message">Dear Alishba,</p>
        <p>
            I know I messed up, and I deeply regret it. You mean so much to me, and I feel terrible for causing you any pain. 
            Our friendship is one of the most important things in my life, and I hope we can work through this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that my actions were hurtful, and I'm committed to doing better. Please forgive me, and let's go back to laughing and sharing awesome memories like we always do.
        </p>
        <p class="final-question">Will you forgive me?</p>
